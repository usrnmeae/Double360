# Double360
Postion Generator for Double360 variant of Chess.
Chess 360 is a subvariant of chess960 (also known as fischer random) where no pawn is undefended. The name double360 implies that
the starting position will not (in general) be symmeterical.
Since a given starting position can be approached in 2 ways (one as white and another as black), the total number of unique 
starting position possible is 360*360*2 = 259200. 
If a player plays a 15+15 classical games for 6 hours daily, then he/she has 18000 days ~ 50 years of unique chess from move 0.

The goal of this (incomplete) project is to creat an web-app which could collaborate automatically with lichess to generate unique
(i.e remember the past position of user and generates a new one untill possible positions are exhausted) starting positions.
At present this process can only be done manually through board editor which is painfull.

Collaborations are welcomed.
